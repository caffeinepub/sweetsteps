  "summary": "The diff does not show any changes to the actual \"Onboarding Incomplete\" screen or its \"Start Onboarding\" button. Instead, it adds onboarding-step reset logic in `Onboarding.tsx` and adds a `handleStartOnboarding` navigation handler in `WeeklyMountain.tsx`, but there is no evidence the onboarding-incomplete CTA is fixed or that a stable `data-testid` was added.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Fix the Onboarding Incomplete screen CTA so clicking \"Start Onboarding\" always navigates to `/onboarding` reliably (not a no-op), works on repeated clicks, and is not blocked by redirects/loading/stale handlers; no unintended redirect back to `/weekly-mountain` while onboarding-incomplete.",
      "reason": "No diff evidence shows edits to the Onboarding Incomplete screen or its \"Start Onboarding\" button wiring. The only navigation-to-`/onboarding` handler shown is in `WeeklyMountain.tsx`, and `Onboarding.tsx` changes do not demonstrate fixing the CTA on the onboarding-incomplete screen itself.",
