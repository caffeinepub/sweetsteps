  "summary": "A new `TaskModal` component file was added with internal timer state and `setInterval`-based countdown logic, but the diff also shows modifications to two other files, violating the constraint to only add the new component file. Several UI-specific acceptance criteria (slider range, exact buttons/labels, and the finished confirmation UI) cannot be fully verified due to truncation.",

      "requirement": "Do not change any other files besides adding the new `TaskModal` component file.",

      "requirement": "When the countdown reaches 0, the modal shows: “Did you finish this task?” with two buttons: YES and NO.",
      "reason": "Timer logic sets `timerState` to `'finished'` at 0, but the rendered UI for the finished/confirmation step is not visible in the truncated snippet, so this cannot be confirmed implemented.",

      "requirement": "When `isOpen` is `true`, the UI includes a slider to adjust the timer from 5 to 60 minutes and a “Start Timer” button.",
      "reason": "State clamps minutes to [5,60], but the actual `Slider` configuration (min/max/step) and the presence/label of the “Start Timer” button are not visible due to truncation.",

      "requirement": "While running, the UI shows the countdown plus a “Pause” button and a “Cancel Timer” button; pausing stops the interval without resetting remaining time; resuming continues from paused time.",
      "reason": "Handlers and state transitions for pause/resume/cancel exist, but the UI elements/labels and resume control are not visible in the truncated render output, so this cannot be confirmed.",
