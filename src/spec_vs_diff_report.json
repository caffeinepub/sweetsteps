  "summary": "Diff implements canister-side deletion via a new `deleteCallerUserData()` shared method with existing permission checks, and adds an `AuthenticatedHeader` component exposing in-app Logout and Delete Account actions. Logout clears Internet Identity session (`useInternetIdentity().clear()`), clears onboarding/localStorage cache keys via `clearSweetStepsSession()`, clears React Query cache, and navigates to `/`. Delete Account confirms (via AlertDialog components), calls backend deletion, then performs the same clear/reset and navigation; on failure it shows an English error message.",
