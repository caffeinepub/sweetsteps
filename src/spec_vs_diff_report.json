  "summary": "Diff modifies Landing page and two project metadata/text files. Landing.tsx appears to increase the carousel/container min-height and adds keyboard navigation logic, but evidence does not show a targeted style adjustment applied ONLY to the single inner card element identified by the provided XPath. Additional non-requested changes include edits to frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json, and keyboard navigation behavior.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Increase the rendered height of the specific selected element in the “Why SweetSteps?” modal carousel (the element corresponding to the provided XPath) so text is not cut off, applying the change ONLY to that element and not altering surrounding carousel layout beyond what’s strictly necessary.",
      "reason": "The available diff evidence indicates a change described as increasing the \"carousel container height\" via min-height classes, but does not show a targeted style adjustment limited to the single inner card element specified by XPath. This suggests the change may have been applied to a container/surrounding layout rather than exclusively to the identified element.",
