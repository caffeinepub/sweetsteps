It uses DFINITY Internet Identity for authentication, bootstraps backend RBAC via a shared secret, and gates a one-time onboarding flow that generates a placeholder (or optionally AI-generated) goal plan. The frontend provides core routes for Landing, Signup/Login, a multi-step Onboarding wizard with a plan preview carousel, placeholder Weekly/Daily dashboards, and a Chocolate Fridge rewards dashboard with period toggles and inventory cards. Styling is a chocolate-themed Tailwind/shadcn-ui design system using OKLCH tokens and Google Fonts.",

    "Backend actor creation is centralized in `useActor` and cached via React Query keyed by principal; when the actor changes, other queries are invalidated/refetched.",
    "Sensitive bootstrap secrets (e.g., `caffeineAdminToken`) are expected in the URL hash, persisted in `sessionStorage`, and removed from the address bar via `history.replaceState`.",
    "Client routing uses TanStack Router with a root layout and route-based pages.",
    "UI uses Tailwind + shadcn-ui components, with global OKLCH CSS-variable tokens and Google Fonts (Cantata One + Source Sans 3).",
    "SPA deep-link support is implemented via `public/404.html` redirecting to `index.html` for static/IC asset hosting.",
    "An AI client exists for OpenAI-compatible chat-completions (defaulting to Groq), but onboarding currently uses a local placeholder generator rather than wiring the AI client into the onboarding flow.",
    "Introduced a `build-template/` scaffold containing a full ICP project template (backend/frontend canister.yaml, Dockerfile, deploy scripts, workspace/package manifests) intended for reproducible builds and exports (e.g., GitHub/ICP CLI workflows).",
    "Added `build-template/` maintenance scripts for asset/image processing (`prune-unused-images.js`, `resize-images.js`) as part of the template toolchain.",
    "Expanded `build-template/src/frontend/` to include a comprehensive shadcn-ui component set and supporting config (eslint rules/config, postcss, tsconfig, vite config), establishing the template’s baseline UI/component library footprint.",
    "`build-template/` expanded into a more complete exportable ICP CLI/GitHub-ready scaffold, adding top-level project metadata and tooling (e.g., Dockerfile, LICENSE/README, deploy script, icp.yaml, pnpm workspace/package manifests and lockfile).",
    "Daily SweetSteps task interaction will use a self-contained TaskModal controlled by props (isOpen, task, onClose, onComplete); internal timer uses setInterval and must fully reset on close/cancel.",
    "Implemented `frontend/src/components/TaskModal.tsx` as a self-contained modal controlled via props (`isOpen`, `task`, `onClose`, `onComplete`); timer runs via `setInterval` and state fully resets on close/cancel."

  "known_issues": [
    "Backend RBAC assignments and onboarding completion state are stored in non-stable, in-memory maps; canister upgrades/reinstalls will lose roles and onboarding completion data.",
    "`AccessControl.getUserRole` traps for any non-anonymous principal not registered via initialization; since `hasPermission()` calls `getUserRole()`, permission-gated methods can trap if `_initializeAccessControlWithSecret` was not successfully called.",
    "`_initializeAccessControlWithSecret` traps if the `CAFFEINE_ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable is not set; because the frontend calls this during authenticated actor creation, auth flows can break entirely when the canister is misconfigured.",
    "`OnboardingResultContext` exists and `SweetSummit` reads from it, but `Onboarding.tsx` never calls `setOnboardingResult`, so navigating to `/sweet-summit` typically shows the empty-state screen.",
    "The AI client reads `VITE_AI_API_KEY` in the browser; enabling it exposes the key to end users unless moved behind a trusted backend/proxy.",
    "Modal/carousel UIs (Landing and Onboarding step 4) do not implement full dialog accessibility (e.g., focus trapping, `role=\"dialog\"`, `aria-modal`).",
    "`WeeklyMountain.tsx` imports `Mountain` from `lucide-react` but does not use it (minor lint issue).",
    "There is an empty/redundant `frontend/index.css` alongside `frontend/src/index.css`, which can confuse contributors about the single source of truth for global styles.",
    "Chocolate Fridge period toggle buttons (e.g., \"All Time\") can be cut off due to full-height/no-scroll layout; needs reduced padding/more compact toggle row."
